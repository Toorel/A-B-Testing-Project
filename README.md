# A-B-Testing-Project
## A/B Testing Experiment to assess if adding reading time affected the possibility of reading the article

This project conducts a randomized control trial to obtain the causal impact of attaching reading time to an article and if that affects the willingness to read the article.
The sample of respondents was divided into the control group and the treatment group. In addition, causal affect was also checked across race, gender and age.
